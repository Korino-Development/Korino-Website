	<p class="text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200 leading-6 tracking-wide mt-2">
		Currently we only have a MiningPvP gamemode but it is very fun.
		We are actively working on adding more gamemodes and are working on a Survival gamemode.
		In the future, we want to be a minigames server with way more gamemodes but that will take a while.
		If you wish to speed up this process, you can visit our store at <code>store.spooki.xyz</code>.
