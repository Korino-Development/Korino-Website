# Korino Website 🌐
The Korino Website is a website for Korino Development to showcase all projects such as the Korii Bot, Korino PvP Minecraft Server and the Korino World Discord Server.

## Installing & Running 📥
I do not recommend you run it yourself, you can visit a live demo at [`this link`](https://spooki.xyz), but here is the guide anyways. Make sure you have installed [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) before trying to do this.
1. Install the project's dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Run a development server: `npm run dev`.
3. Build the project: `npm run build`.
Pretty easy, huh?
